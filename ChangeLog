  - change the way of announcing configure results to headers

2008-05-01 tommi@tntnet.org
  - use pipl-idiom in cxxtools::Dir to remove needed includes in public header
  - allow ':' in httprequests and other small improvements and add
    documentation to http client classes
  - add wrapper for regex(3)

2008-03-31 marc
  - added conversion functions

2008-03-27 tommi@tntnet.org
  - increase default tcp buffer size from 256 to 8192 bytes

2008-03-09 tommi@tntnet.org
  - remove the queing of log messages since it was not reliable
  - translate api-documentation of network classes to english
  - add a flush parameter to cxxtools::net::Stream::write to allow partial
    writes and use this in cxxtools::net::iostream::overflow, so that overflow
    always tries to write the full buffer.

2008-02-21 tommi@tntnet.org
  - new command line utility cxxlog to use the logger in shell scripts

2008-12-27 tommi@tntnet.org
  - add classes for creation of mime mails

2007-11-13 tommi@tntnet.org

2007-11-01 tommi@tntnet.org
  - cxxtools::Any and compile-time typeinfo (Marc)

2007-10-17 tommi@tntnet.org
  - remove libltdl code completely
  - implement destroy-policy for cxxtools::SmartPtr

2007-10-12 tommi@tntnet.org
  - signal-slot (Marc)

2007-09-16 tommi@tntnet.org
  - don't use libltdl by default since it brings more problems than it solves.
    On linux we need RTLD_GLOBAL in dlopen to make exceptions and rtti
    working. libltdl does not pass that flag. On Aix shared libraries has a
    extension .a by default, which is not recognized by libltdl.

2007-07-07 tommi@tntnet.org
  - rewritten ini-file-parser
  - make iconv unconditional and make iconv-buffer bigger for better
    performance
  - properties-file-parser

    setting disabled to 1 (or 'y' or 'Y' or 't' or 'T')

2007-05-11 tommi@tntnet.org
  - make cxxtools::Pool working again
  - build-improvements (port to solaris/SunStudio)

2007-05-04 tommi@tntnet.org
  - replace std::string with char* as a buffer in udpstream-class
  - remove RWLOCK_MUTEX_INITIALIZER because this is unknown on Mac OS X and
    the rwlock_t-structure is anyway initalized with pthread_rwlock_init

2007-05-03 tommi@tntnet.org
  - bugfix: clear buffer of udpstream after sending message
  - make cxxtools::socket::doPoll-method public and rename to poll

2007-04-26 tommi@tntnet.org

    to create a socket, if first addrinfo-entry does not work.

2007-04-20 tommi@tntnet.org
  - fix stream-classes to conform ANSI

2007-04-18 tommi@tntnet.org
  - remove double-lock in pool-class, which resulted in a deadlock on solaris

2007-04-17 tommi@tntnet.org
  - another change in initialization in std::ios-derived classes after reading
    the c++-standard (now std::ios::init is used for initialization)

2007-04-11 tommi@tntnet.org
  - don't pass uninitialized std::streabuf to base-class in classes
    derived from std::[io]stream. This should be ok, but at least
    Sun Studio 11 fails here.

2007-03-25 tommi@tntnet.org

    of pool settable

  - wrappers for fork(2) and pipe(2) and a std::iostream on top of pipe(2)
  - cxxtools::Fdstream: std::iostream for filedescriptors

    report eof instead

2007-01-15 tommi@tntnet.org

  - make offset in hexdumper settable
  - logging-improvement (don't try to output current logstatement when
    exception occurs during creation of log-message)
  - Condition::timedwait

2006-12-31 tommi@tntnet.org

  - improve eof-handling in socket-class

2006-12-28 tommi@tntnet.org

    accidentally converting QueryParams-objects into const_iterator

2006-11-22 tommi@tntnet.org

  - "putchar" is a macro somewhere - rename member-method to workaround
    this name-conflict

2006-07-27 tommi@tntnet.org

  - fix iconvstream

2006-06-21 tommi@tntnet.org

  - license changed to LGPL

2006-05-24 tommi@tntnet.org

  - fix tcp-client: create socket when known, which to create
    this fixes also problems in running any applications on systems without
    IPv6

  - flushdelay works now with rolling-files
  - ANSI-C++-fixes

2006-03-02 tommi@tntnet.org

  - new logging-parameter flushdelay, which speeds up logging
    by starting a backgroundthread, which flushes asynchronous
